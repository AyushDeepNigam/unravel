    description: `Israel's geographical structure is diverse and the climate conditions are mostly harsh. With desertification on the rise globally and water sources shriking constantly, its pretty challenging get agricultural facilities through natural resources.`,
    solution: `Israel has developed certain system and technologies in order to face these issues

1. Drip Irrigation
   The most efficient irrigation
   technique on earth.
2. They developed a system controller    which monitors the climate and    control in greenhouses namely    temperature, humidity and    ventilation control through their    advance systems.
3. Precision Agriculture
   Some advanced systems developed in
Israel enable them to map and analyse crops and accurately observe and measure all parameters necessary for an ideal habitat for the plant, while maximizing resource utilization.

4. Extended Shelf life
Prob- After the fruit or vegetable has be picked, it's th post-harvest period in which fruit's quality gradually degrades which results in produce losses which in turn makes the financial losses

Soln - In order to increase the shelf life of a fruit without change in the taste or aroma , the volcanic center in Israel has researched and developed certain techniques which condition the fruit and vegetables in such a way that their life increases even after they are plucked without any change in their quality.

5. Aquaponics

   An intelligent way of farming articially, where hydroponic culture i.e. process of of growing plants without soil, and fish culture or aqua-culture can be done simultaneously for more revenue in a smaller region. This process is scalable from a micro to a macro level.`,

    title: `Vertical Car Parking`,
    date: `4th May, 2020`,
    genre: `Other`,
    description: `One of the most common problems today is a saturation of parking spaces. Vehicles continue to outnumber existing parking spaces, thus clogging roads. Incidences of violence over occupancy, deformed cars due to a space crunch, and overcharging for parking are some problems that result. What could be the solution that can be implemented practically in metro cities ?`,
    solution: `This Compact vertical Car Park(parklift, combiparker 551, 556)  with revolving elevators is possibly a good  solution for a big city. With a rotating lift system on a vertical steel structure, it occupies a small area that normally would be enough for only two or three cars without the system, with the system you can park about seventeen cars. In our modern world with so much traffic jamming. Thus finding out the fact that this is being practically implemented somewhere across the globe, this can turn out to be a simple solution to such a big problem.`,
